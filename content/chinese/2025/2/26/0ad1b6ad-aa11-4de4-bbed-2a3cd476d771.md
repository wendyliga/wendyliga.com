丽丽和她的爷爷住在漂亮的小房子里。房子后面有一个小花园。一天，爷爷对丽丽说：“明天是植树节，我们一起在花园里种一棵小树，好吗？”

丽丽高兴地说：“好啊！种什么树呢？”

爷爷笑着说：“我们种一棵苹果树吧。这样，以后我们就可以吃到自己种的苹果了。”

第二天，丽丽和爷爷一起在花园里挖了一个小坑。爷爷把小树苗小心地放进坑里，然后丽丽用小铲子把土填回去。爷爷告诉丽丽：“种树不仅仅是为了吃到水果，也是为了保护环境。树可以帮助我们呼吸新鲜空气。”

丽丽认真地点点头。她每天都给小树浇水。过了一段时间，小树长大了，长出了绿色的叶子。丽丽很开心，她知道自己种的树会给世界带来更多美好。她也明白了植树节的意义，并且更加喜欢这个节日了。

## English Translation

Lili and her grandfather live in a beautiful little house. Behind the house is a small garden. One day, grandfather said to Lili, "Tomorrow is Arbor Day, let's plant a small tree in the garden together, okay?"

Lili happily said, "Okay! What kind of tree should we plant?"

Grandfather said with a smile, "Let's plant an apple tree. That way, we can eat the apples we planted ourselves in the future."

The next day, Lili and her grandfather dug a small pit in the garden together. Grandfather carefully put the sapling into the pit, and then Lili used a small shovel to fill the soil back in. Grandfather told Lili, "Planting trees is not just for eating fruit, but also for protecting the environment. Trees can help us breathe fresh air."

Lili nodded seriously. She watered the small tree every day. After a while, the small tree grew bigger and sprouted green leaves. Lili was very happy. She knew that the tree she planted would bring more beauty to the world. She also understood the meaning of Arbor Day and liked this holiday even more.
