丽丽第一次去农贸市场。她有点儿紧张，因为她从来没有自己买过菜。她的朋友小明知道她不太会说价钱，所以陪她一起去了。

市场里很热闹，人很多，声音也很大。丽丽看着各种各样的蔬菜和水果，觉得很新鲜。

小明指着一堆西红柿说：“丽丽，你想买西红柿吗？我们可以问问价钱。”

丽丽点点头，走到一个卖西红柿的摊位前，问：“请问，西红柿多少钱一斤？”

卖菜的人说：“五块钱一斤。”

小明小声对丽丽说：“你可以说贵一点儿，试试能不能便宜一点儿。”

丽丽深吸一口气，对卖菜的人说：“阿姨，有点儿贵，能不能四块钱一斤？”

卖菜的阿姨笑着说：“好吧，看你们是第一次来，就四块五一斤吧。”

丽丽高兴地说：“谢谢阿姨！” 她买了两斤西红柿。

之后，他们又买了其他的蔬菜。有了小明的帮助，丽丽学会了怎么说价钱，还成功地买到了新鲜的蔬菜。她觉得很高兴，决定以后经常来农贸市场买菜。

## English Translation

Lili went to the farmer's market for the first time. She was a little nervous because she had never bought vegetables herself before. Her friend Xiaoming knew that she wasn't very good at bargaining, so he went with her.

The market was very lively, with many people and a lot of noise. Lili looked at the various vegetables and fruits and found them very fresh.

Xiaoming pointed to a pile of tomatoes and said, "Lili, do you want to buy tomatoes? We can ask about the price."

Lili nodded and walked to a tomato stall, asking, "Excuse me, how much are the tomatoes per jin?"

The vendor said, "Five yuan per jin."

Xiaoming whispered to Lili, "You can say it's a little expensive, try to see if you can get it a little cheaper."

Lili took a deep breath and said to the vendor, "Auntie, it's a little expensive, can you make it four yuan per jin?"

The vendor smiled and said, "Okay, seeing that it's your first time here, I'll make it four yuan fifty per jin."

Lili happily said, "Thank you, Auntie!" She bought two jin of tomatoes.

After that, they bought other vegetables. With Xiaoming's help, Lili learned how to bargain and successfully bought fresh vegetables. She felt very happy and decided to come to the farmer's market often to buy vegetables in the future.
