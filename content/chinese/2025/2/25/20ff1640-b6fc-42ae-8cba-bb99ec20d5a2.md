## English Translation

Lili and Xiaoming are good friends. They often study and play together. One day, Lili asked Xiaoming, "Can you play Chinese chess?"

Xiaoming shook his head and said, "No, I can't. But, I really want to learn. How about you?"

Lili smiled and said, "I can't either. But, my dad can. We can ask him to teach us."

They happily went to find Lili's dad. Lili's dad was very happy to teach them.

On the first day, Lili's dad taught them to recognize the chess pieces and rules of Chinese chess. They felt it was a little difficult, but very interesting.

On the second day, they started practicing playing Chinese chess. Lili always lost to Xiaoming. She was a little unhappy.

Xiaoming said, "Don't worry, Lili. I also often lose to my grandpa. Just practice more and it will be fine."

Lili listened to Xiaoming's words and continued to practice hard. After a week, Lili finally won against Xiaoming once. She jumped up happily!

From then on, Lili and Xiaoming played Chinese chess together every day. They not only learned to play Chinese chess, but also became more understanding of each other.
