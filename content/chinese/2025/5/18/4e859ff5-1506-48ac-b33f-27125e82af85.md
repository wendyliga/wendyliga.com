丽丽和小明是好朋友。他们每天一起上学，一起玩。春天来了，学校的花园里很漂亮。丽丽对小明说：“我们一起在花园里种一棵小树，好吗？”小明说：“好啊！这棵小树会慢慢长大，将来变成一棵参天大树。”

他们一起准备了小树苗、水和一把小铲子。他们在花园里找了一块空地，小明用铲子挖了一个小坑。丽丽小心地把小树苗放进坑里，然后他们一起用土把坑填满。他们给小树浇了很多水。

每天放学后，丽丽和小明都会来看小树。他们看看小树有没有长大，有没有生病。几个月过去了，小树长高了一点点，也长出了几片新叶子。

有一天，丽丽发现小树的叶子有点黄了。她很担心，就问小明：“小树怎么了？它是不是生病了？”小明说：“别担心，可能只是缺水了。我们多浇点水试试。”他们每天都给小树浇水，很快，小树的叶子又变绿了。

一年过去了，小树已经长大了不少。丽丽和小明都很高兴。他们知道，只要用心照顾，小树一定会长成一棵参天大树。他们也明白了，友谊就像小树一样，需要他们用心呵护才能长久。

## English Translation

Lili and Xiaoming are good friends. They go to school and play together every day. Spring has come, and the school garden is very beautiful. Lili said to Xiaoming, "Let's plant a small tree in the garden together, okay?" Xiaoming said, "Okay! This small tree will slowly grow up and become a towering tree in the future."

Together, they prepared a small sapling, water, and a small shovel. They found an open space in the garden, and Xiaoming used the shovel to dig a small pit. Lili carefully put the sapling into the pit, and then they filled the pit with soil together. They watered the small tree a lot.

Every day after school, Lili and Xiaoming would come to see the small tree. They checked if the small tree had grown taller and if it was sick. Several months passed, and the small tree grew a little taller and grew a few new leaves.

One day, Lili noticed that the leaves of the small tree were a little yellow. She was very worried and asked Xiaoming, "What's wrong with the small tree? Is it sick?" Xiaoming said, "Don't worry, maybe it's just lacking water. Let's try watering it more." They watered the small tree every day, and soon, the leaves of the small tree turned green again.

A year has passed, and the small tree has grown a lot. Lili and Xiaoming are very happy. They know that as long as they take care of it carefully, the small tree will definitely grow into a towering tree. They also understood that friendship is like a small tree, and it needs them to carefully nurture it to last.
