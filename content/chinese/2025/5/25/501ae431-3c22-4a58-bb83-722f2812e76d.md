小明学会了骑自行车。他非常高兴，因为他现在可以自己去很多地方了。今天，小明决定第一次骑自行车去丽丽家玩。丽丽是他的好朋友，他们经常一起玩游戏。

小明记得丽丽家在公园的附近，但是他不太清楚具体的路。他骑着自行车，一边看风景，一边找丽丽家。可是，他骑了很久，都没有看到公园。小明开始有点着急了，他发现自己迷路了！

“怎么办呢？” 小明心里想。“我应该问问别人。” 于是，他停下来，问了一个路过的叔叔：“叔叔，请问去公园怎么走？” 叔叔告诉他：“你走错了方向，公园在你的后面，你往回骑，看到红绿灯左转就到了。”

小明听了叔叔的话，往回骑。他看到了红绿灯，然后左转。骑了一会儿，他终于看到了公园！他在公园旁边找到了丽丽家。丽丽看到小明来了，非常开心。他们一起玩了很多好玩的游戏，度过了愉快的一天。虽然小明迷路了，但是他最终还是找到了丽丽家，而且学会了问路。

## English Translation

Xiao Ming learned how to ride a bicycle. He was very happy because he could now go to many places by himself. Today, Xiao Ming decided to ride his bicycle to Lili's house for the first time. Lili is his good friend, and they often play games together.

Xiao Ming remembered that Lili's house was near the park, but he wasn't very clear about the specific route. He rode his bicycle, looking at the scenery while searching for Lili's house. However, he rode for a long time and didn't see the park. Xiao Ming began to get a little anxious, and he realized he was lost!

"What should I do?" Xiao Ming thought to himself. "I should ask someone." So, he stopped and asked a passing uncle, "Uncle, excuse me, how do I get to the park?" The uncle told him, "You've gone in the wrong direction. The park is behind you. Ride back, and turn left when you see the traffic light, and you'll be there."

Xiao Ming listened to the uncle's words and rode back. He saw the traffic light and then turned left. After riding for a while, he finally saw the park! He found Lili's house next to the park. Lili was very happy to see Xiao Ming. They played many fun games together and had a pleasant day. Although Xiao Ming got lost, he eventually found Lili's house and also learned how to ask for directions.
