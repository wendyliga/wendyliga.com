## English Translation

Lili wanted to prepare a Mother's Day gift for her mom. She was very worried, not knowing what to give. Her good friend Xiaoming found out and came to find her.

"Lili, why are you unhappy?" Xiaoming asked.

Lili sighed and said, "Mother's Day is coming soon, and I want to give my mom a surprise, but I don't know what to give. Flowers are too ordinary, and Mom doesn't lack clothes."

Xiaoming smiled and said, "I know! Why don't we make a special dish together? Your mom loves to eat the food you make the most."

Lili's eyes lit up: "Really? What dish should we make?"

Xiaoming thought for a moment and said, "We can make sweet and sour fish. Your mom likes to eat sweet and sour things, and fish is also very nutritious."

Lili happily said: "That's great! Let's go buy groceries now!"

They went to the supermarket together and bought fish and other needed materials. Back home, they began to seriously cook. Lili was responsible for washing the fish and cutting vegetables, and Xiaoming was responsible for the seasoning. They cooked and chatted and laughed, and were very happy.

Finally, the sweet and sour fish was ready. Lili took a bite, sweet and sour, the taste was great! She believed her mom would definitely like it.

On Mother's Day, Lili and her mom ate this special sweet and sour fish together. Mom ate with relish and happily said, "This is the best gift I've ever received!" Lili and Xiaoming were very happy when they heard that.
