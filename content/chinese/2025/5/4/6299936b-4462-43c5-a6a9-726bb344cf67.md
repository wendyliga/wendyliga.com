丽丽和小明周末帮爸爸妈妈打扫房子。他们找到了一些旧的相册。

“哇！妈妈，这是你小时候的照片吗？” 丽丽好奇地问。

妈妈笑着说：“是啊，那时候我还很小，在乡下长大。你看，这是我和我的哥哥一起玩泥巴。”

小明也凑过来看。“爸爸，这张照片是你吗？你以前头发好多啊！”

爸爸哈哈大笑：“是啊，年轻的时候头发很多。这是我在大学踢足球的照片。”

爸爸妈妈开始回忆他们小时候的事情。他们讲了很多有趣的故事，比如妈妈小时候爬树掏鸟窝，爸爸小时候偷偷去河里游泳。丽丽和小明听得津津有味，感觉好像自己也回到了过去。

丽丽说：“爸爸妈妈，你们小时候真有趣！你们能多讲一些吗？”

小明也说：“我想知道更多关于我们家的历史。”

爸爸妈妈看着孩子们，心里非常高兴。他们决定以后多和孩子们分享一些家里的故事。那天，丽丽和小明不仅帮家里打扫了房子，还了解了很多关于他们父母的童年，对他们的家庭历史产生了浓厚的兴趣。

## English Translation

Lili and Xiaoming helped their parents clean the house on the weekend. They found some old photo albums.

"Wow! Mom, is this a photo of you when you were little?" Lili asked curiously.

Mom smiled and said, "Yes, I was very young then, and I grew up in the countryside. Look, this is me playing in the mud with my older brother."

Xiaoming also came over to look. "Dad, is this you in the photo? You had so much hair before!"

Dad laughed loudly, "Yes, I had a lot of hair when I was young. This is a photo of me playing soccer in college."

Mom and Dad started to reminisce about their childhood. They told many interesting stories, such as Mom climbing trees to steal birds' nests when she was little, and Dad secretly going swimming in the river. Lili and Xiaoming listened with great interest, feeling like they had returned to the past.

Lili said, "Mom and Dad, your childhoods were so interesting! Can you tell us more?"

Xiaoming also said, "I want to know more about our family history."

Mom and Dad looked at their children and felt very happy. They decided to share more family stories with their children in the future. That day, Lili and Xiaoming not only helped clean the house, but also learned a lot about their parents' childhoods, developing a strong interest in their family history.
