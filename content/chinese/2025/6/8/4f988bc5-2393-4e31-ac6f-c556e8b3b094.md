小明今天在公园里玩。他看到一棵大树下有一只小鸟。小鸟的翅膀受伤了，不能飞。小明觉得小鸟很可怜。

他把小鸟轻轻地拿回家。小明的妈妈看到了，说：“我们照顾它吧。”小明很高兴。他们给小鸟准备了一个小盒子，里面放了一些软布。小明每天给小鸟喂水和米饭。

几天后，小鸟的翅膀好了一点。小明每天带它到公园里，让它练习飞。开始的时候，小鸟飞得很慢，也很矮。但是，小明一直鼓励它：“加油！你可以的！”

过了一个星期，小鸟终于可以飞得很高很远了。有一天，小明打开盒子，小鸟飞了出去。它在空中盘旋了几圈，好像在和小明说再见。小明看着小鸟飞走，心里有点难过，但是也为小鸟感到高兴。他知道，小鸟自由了！

## English Translation

Today, Xiao Ming was playing in the park. He saw a little bird under a big tree. The little bird's wing was injured and it couldn't fly. Xiao Ming felt very sorry for the little bird.

He gently took the little bird home. Xiao Ming's mom saw it and said, "Let's take care of it." Xiao Ming was very happy. They prepared a small box for the little bird and put some soft cloth inside. Every day, Xiao Ming fed the little bird water and rice.

After a few days, the little bird's wing got a little better. Every day, Xiao Ming took it to the park and let it practice flying. In the beginning, the little bird flew very slowly and low. But Xiao Ming kept encouraging it: "Add oil! You can do it!"

After a week, the little bird could finally fly very high and far. One day, Xiao Ming opened the box, and the little bird flew out. It circled in the air a few times, as if saying goodbye to Xiao Ming. Xiao Ming watched the little bird fly away, feeling a little sad in his heart, but also happy for the little bird. He knew, the little bird was free!
