小明想学骑自行车。他看到朋友们骑车玩，觉得很开心，也想和他们一样。

第一天，小明请爸爸教他。爸爸扶着自行车，小明小心地坐上去。可是，自行车不太听话，摇摇晃晃的。 “别怕，看着前面！” 爸爸说。小明很紧张，一下子就摔倒了。

小明有点儿疼，但他没有放弃。他站起来，重新坐上自行车。他又试了几次，每次都摔倒了。爸爸说：“没关系，慢慢来，多练习几次就好了。”

第二天，小明自己练习。他还是摔倒了很多次，膝盖也擦破了。但他坚持不懈，一次又一次地尝试。

终于，有一天，小明感觉自己可以控制自行车了。他可以慢慢地骑起来，不用爸爸扶着了！他很高兴，大声喊：“我会骑自行车了！”

从那以后，小明每天都骑自行车和朋友们一起玩，他觉得很自由，也很开心。他明白了，只要坚持，就一定能成功。

## English Translation

Xiao Ming wanted to learn to ride a bicycle. He saw his friends riding and playing, felt very happy, and wanted to be like them.

On the first day, Xiao Ming asked his dad to teach him. Dad held the bicycle, and Xiao Ming carefully sat on it. But the bicycle was not very obedient, wobbling back and forth. "Don't be afraid, look ahead!" Dad said. Xiao Ming was very nervous and fell down immediately.

Xiao Ming felt a little sore, but he did not give up. He stood up and got back on the bicycle. He tried several more times, and fell down every time. Dad said, "It's okay, take your time, practice a few more times and it will be fine."

On the second day, Xiao Ming practiced by himself. He still fell down many times, and his knees were scraped. But he persevered, trying again and again.

Finally, one day, Xiao Ming felt that he could control the bicycle. He could slowly ride, without Dad holding him! He was very happy and shouted loudly, "I can ride a bicycle!"

From then on, Xiao Ming rode his bicycle every day and played with his friends. He felt very free and happy. He understood that as long as you persevere, you will surely succeed.
