丽丽很喜欢下象棋。今天，她想教她的朋友小明。

“小明，你想学下象棋吗？”丽丽问。

Lili Teaches Xiaoming How to Play Chinese Chess

"Xiaoming, do you want to learn how to play Chinese chess?" Lili asked.

Xiaoming doesn't really understand Chinese chess, he said, "Okay, I'll give it a try."

Lili took out the Chinese chess set. She told Xiaoming the name and how to move each piece. "This is the 'chariot' (rook), it can move in a straight line. This is the 'horse' (knight), it moves in the shape of the character '日' (rì)."

In the beginning, Xiaoming felt it was very difficult. He always made mistakes. Lili was very patient, teaching him again and again. "It's okay, take your time."
