丽丽和小明第一次去动物园。他们很高兴，也很紧张。

动物园里有很多动物。他们先看到了猴子，猴子很可爱，他们笑了。然后，他们听到了很大的声音。“这是什么声音？”丽丽问。小明说：“我也不知道，好像是狮子的叫声。”

他们慢慢地走过去，看到了狮子。狮子很大，声音也很可怕。丽丽和小明有点害怕，他们想离开。

这时，一位饲养员走了过来。他笑着说：“你们好！狮子很友好，它只是在打招呼。” 他还说：“狮子每天都吃很多肉，也要睡觉休息。我们会好好照顾它。”

最后，他们开心地离开了狮子馆，继续参观其他的动物。他们觉得今天的动物园之旅非常有趣。

## English Translation

Lili and Xiaoming went to the zoo for the first time. They were very happy and a little nervous.

There were many animals in the zoo. They first saw monkeys, the monkeys were very cute, and they laughed. Then, they heard a loud noise. "What is that sound?" Lili asked. Xiaoming said, "I don't know either, it sounds like a lion's roar."

They slowly walked over and saw the lion. The lion was very big, and its voice was scary. Lili and Xiaoming were a little scared, and they wanted to leave.

At this time, a zookeeper came over. He said with a smile, "Hello! The lion is very friendly, it's just saying hello." He also said, "The lion eats a lot of meat every day, and also needs to sleep and rest. We will take good care of it."

Lili and Xiaoming listened to the zookeeper's words and were no longer afraid. They looked at the lion carefully and found that the lion was actually very beautiful and majestic. They felt that the lion was no longer scary, but very magnificent.

Finally, they happily left the lion enclosure and continued to visit other animals. They thought today's zoo trip was very interesting.
