丽丽和小明是好朋友。一个星期六，他们一起去公园玩。在公园里，他们发现了一个小鸟窝。这个鸟窝很小，里面有三个鸟蛋。鸟窝掉在了地上，看起来是被风吹下来的。

丽丽说：“我们帮帮这些鸟蛋吧！” 小明同意了。他们决定一起照顾这些鸟蛋。他们小心地把鸟窝放回树上，希望鸟妈妈能回来。

每天，丽丽和小明都来公园看鸟窝。他们认真地观察鸟蛋的变化，用本子记录鸟蛋的大小和颜色。他们每天都很期待小鸟出生。

一个星期后，他们听到鸟窝里有声音！他们看到了三只小鸟从蛋里出来了！小鸟很小，叫得很欢快。丽丽和小明非常高兴。他们知道，他们的努力有了结果。他们继续照顾小鸟，直到小鸟长大，可以自己飞走了。

## English Translation

Lili and Xiaoming are good friends. One Saturday, they went to the park together to play. In the park, they found a small bird's nest. The bird's nest was very small, and there were three bird eggs inside. The bird's nest had fallen on the ground, and it looked like it had been blown down by the wind.

Lili said, "Let's help these bird eggs!" Xiaoming agreed. They decided to take care of the bird eggs together. They carefully put the bird's nest back in the tree, hoping the mother bird would come back.

Every day, Lili and Xiaoming came to the park to see the bird's nest. They carefully observed the changes in the bird eggs, and used a notebook to record the size and color of the bird eggs. They looked forward to the little birds hatching every day.

A week later, they heard sounds in the bird's nest! They saw three little birds come out of the eggs! The little birds were very small and chirped happily. Lili and Xiaoming were very happy. They knew that their efforts had paid off. They continued to take care of the little birds until the little birds grew up and could fly away on their own.
