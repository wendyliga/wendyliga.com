## English Translation

Lili went to the store to buy some things today. She bought fruit, vegetables, and bread. The things were a bit heavy, but she felt it was okay.

Walking out of the store, Lili saw an old grandma. The grandma looked very old, and she was carrying two big shopping bags. Those bags looked very heavy.

Lili felt the grandma needed help. She walked next to the grandma and asked in a polite tone: "Grandma, hello! Can I help you? Your bags look very heavy."

The grandma said with a smile: "Hello, thank you! My home is on the fifth floor, and it's too difficult to carry these things upstairs."

Lili said: "It's okay, let me help you!" Lili helped the grandma carry one shopping bag. They walked upstairs slowly together.

When they arrived on the fifth floor, the grandma was very grateful to Lili. She said: "Thank you, you are such a good child! I don't have anything to give you, here, take this." The grandma took out a candied hawthorn from her pocket and gave it to Lili.

Lili said happily: "Thank you, grandma! You're welcome, helping you is what I should do." Lili held the candied hawthorn, feeling very warm inside.
