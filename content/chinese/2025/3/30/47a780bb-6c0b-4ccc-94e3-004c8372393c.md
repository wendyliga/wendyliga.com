## English Translation

Lili really likes to dance. The school was going to hold a performance, and she wanted to participate, but the teacher said the spots were full. One day, Lili saw Xiaoming secretly practicing dancing in the classroom. Xiaoming was dancing a difficult traditional Chinese dance, and the movements were very beautiful.

Lili was a little angry, feeling why Xiaoming didn't tell her. She also wanted to dance! But, Lili saw that Xiaoming was very serious and worked very hard when he danced. She knew that Xiaoming must have practiced for a long time.

Lili walked up to Xiaoming and asked, "What dance are you practicing? Can I take a look?"

Xiaoming was a little embarrassed and said, "This is a traditional Chinese dance, and I'm going to dance it at the school performance."

Lili said, "Can I learn with you? I also really like to dance, and I can help you."

Xiaoming was very happy and said, "Really? That's great! Let's practice together!"

From then on, Lili and Xiaoming practiced dancing together every day. Lili began to feel that helping others was also very happy. In the end, although Lili didn't participate in the school performance, she learned a new dance, and became good friends with Xiaoming.
