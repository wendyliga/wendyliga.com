丽丽和小明是好朋友。星期六，他们一起去茶园玩。茶园很大，有很多绿色的茶树。

一位茶农叔叔告诉他们，现在是采茶的好时候。丽丽和小明认真地学习怎么采茶。他们用手轻轻地摘下嫩绿的茶叶，放在篮子里。

采完茶后，茶农叔叔带他们去看茶叶是怎么做的。他们看到工人叔叔把茶叶放在机器里炒，然后又晒干。丽丽觉得很神奇。

最后，丽丽和小明用自己采的茶叶泡了一壶茶。他们把茶带回家，给爸爸妈妈和爷爷奶奶喝。家人都说：“真好喝！” 丽丽和小明觉得很高兴，因为他们学到了很多关于茶的知识，也让家人喝到了自己亲手采摘的茶。

## English Translation

Lili and Xiaoming are good friends. On Saturday, they went to a tea plantation together. The tea plantation was very big, with many green tea trees.

A tea farmer uncle told them that now is a good time to pick tea. Lili and Xiaoming carefully learned how to pick tea. They gently picked the tender green tea leaves with their hands and put them in a basket.

After picking the tea, the tea farmer uncle took them to see how tea is made. They saw the worker uncle put the tea leaves in the machine to stir-fry, and then dry them in the sun. Lili felt it was very magical.

Finally, Lili and Xiaoming used the tea leaves they picked to brew a pot of tea. They took the tea home and gave it to their parents and grandparents to drink. The family all said, "It's really delicious!" Lili and Xiaoming felt very happy because they learned a lot about tea and also let their family drink the tea they picked themselves.
