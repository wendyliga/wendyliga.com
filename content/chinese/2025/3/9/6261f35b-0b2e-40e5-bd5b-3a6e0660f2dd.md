丽丽想给小明一个惊喜。她决定学做饺子。丽丽从来没做过饺子，所以她先在网上看了一个视频。视频里，老师教得很仔细。丽丽准备了面粉、肉和菜。

开始做饺子的时候，丽丽发现比想象的难多了。她揉面揉了很久，才揉好。然后她开始包饺子。第一个饺子包得很丑，但是丽丽没有放弃。她认真地学着视频里的样子，一个一个地包。

花了两个小时，丽丽终于包好了一盘饺子。她很高兴，小心地把饺子装进饭盒里，准备送给小明。

丽丽来到小明家，敲了敲门。小明打开门，脸色很不好。丽丽问：“你怎么了？” 小明说：“我有点儿不舒服，头疼，还咳嗽。”

丽丽摸了摸小明的额头，发现他发烧了。丽丽很担心。她让小明躺下休息，然后去厨房烧水。她给小明煮了饺子，还给他拿了药。

小明吃完饺子，吃了药，感觉好多了。丽丽一直陪着他，直到他睡着。丽丽觉得，照顾小明比做饺子更有意义。她学会了，关心别人，比送礼物更重要。第二天，小明病好了，非常感谢丽丽。

## English Translation

Lili wanted to give Xiaoming a surprise. She decided to learn how to make dumplings. Lili had never made dumplings before, so she first watched a video online. In the video, the teacher taught very carefully. Lili prepared flour, meat, and vegetables.

When she started making the dumplings, Lili found it was much harder than she had imagined. She kneaded the dough for a long time before it was ready. Then she started wrapping the dumplings. The first dumpling was very ugly, but Lili didn't give up. She carefully followed the video, wrapping them one by one.

After two hours, Lili finally wrapped a plate of dumplings. She was very happy and carefully packed the dumplings into a lunchbox, ready to give them to Xiaoming.

Lili arrived at Xiaoming's house and knocked on the door. Xiaoming opened the door, and his face looked unwell. Lili asked, "What's wrong?" Xiaoming said, "I feel a little uncomfortable, I have a headache, and I'm coughing."

Lili touched Xiaoming's forehead and found that he had a fever. Lili was very worried. She told Xiaoming to lie down and rest, and then went to the kitchen to boil water. She cooked dumplings for Xiaoming and also got him some medicine.

After Xiaoming ate the dumplings and took the medicine, he felt much better. Lili stayed with him until he fell asleep. Lili felt that taking care of Xiaoming was more meaningful than making dumplings. She learned that caring for others is more important than giving gifts. The next day, Xiaoming recovered and was very grateful to Lili.
