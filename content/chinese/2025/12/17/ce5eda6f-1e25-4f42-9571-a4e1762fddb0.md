## English Translation
Xiaoming and Lili are happy siblings. This year’s Winter Solstice Festival, they decided to learn how to make traditional tangyuan. Their mom first explained the origin of the Winter Solstice Festival and told them that tangyuan symbolizes reunion and happiness. Then, their mom brought out glutinous rice flour, filling ingredients, and some small tools.

“Xiaoming, come help me knead the dough!” Mom said. Xiaoming used his hands to mix the glutinous rice flour with water. Though his hands were covered in flour, he found it very fun. Lili was in charge of making the filling. She mixed red bean paste, sesame, and sugar together, and it smelled wonderfully sweet.

Next, they began wrapping tangyuan. Xiaoming noticed that Lili’s tangyuan were perfectly round and looked great, while his often broke apart. He became a little anxious. Mom noticed this and said with a smile: “Don’t worry, practice a few more times and you’ll get it!” Under mom's guidance, Xiaoming finally learned how to wrap tangyuan.

When the tangyuan was cooked, the whole family sat together to enjoy them. Xiaoming and Lili felt warm as they ate. Xiaoming said to mom: “It turns out tangyuan is not only so delicious but also so interesting to make!” Lili excitedly added: “Next Winter Solstice Festival, we’ll make tangyuan again!”
