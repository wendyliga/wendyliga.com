## 汉字

丽丽在一个中国节日看到了一个古筝表演，觉得非常漂亮。她想，"我也要学古筝！"  回家后，她告诉她的朋友小明，"我要学古筝了！"

小明笑了笑，说："真的吗？你以前学过很多东西，但是都没坚持下去。你真的能学好古筝吗？"

丽丽听了有点生气，但她说："这次不一样！我真的很喜欢古筝的声音，我会努力练习的。"

丽丽开始找老师学习古筝。 刚开始，练习很难，她的手指很疼。但是她没有放弃。她每天都练习一个小时。慢慢地，她开始弹一些简单的曲子。

几个月后，丽丽在小明面前弹了一首曲子。 小明听了很惊讶，他说："哇！你真的学会了！你比我想象的更厉害！"

丽丽笑着说："只要努力，什么都可以做到！"

## English Translation

Lili saw a Guzheng performance at a Chinese festival and thought it was very beautiful. She thought, "I also want to learn the Guzheng!" After returning home, she told her friend Xiaoming, "I'm going to learn the Guzheng!"

Xiaoming smiled and said, "Really? You've learned a lot of things before, but you never stuck with them. Can you really learn the Guzheng well?"

Lili was a little angry when she heard this, but she said, "This time is different! I really like the sound of the Guzheng, and I will practice hard."

Lili started looking for a teacher to learn the Guzheng. At first, practice was very difficult, and her fingers hurt a lot. But she didn't give up. She practiced for an hour every day. Slowly, she started to play some simple tunes.

Several months later, Lili played a song in front of Xiaoming. Xiaoming was very surprised when he heard it. He said, "Wow! You really learned it! You are more amazing than I thought!"

Lili smiled and said, "As long as you work hard, anything can be achieved!"
