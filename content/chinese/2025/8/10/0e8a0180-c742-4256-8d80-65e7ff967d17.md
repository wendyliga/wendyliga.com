奶奶笑着说：“好孩子，多练习几次就好了。” 丽丽按照奶奶的方法，一遍又一遍地练习。她揉面，包馅儿，小心地放进烤箱。

## English Translation

The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and Lili is very happy. She wants to make a special mooncake for her family. Lili’s grandmother makes mooncakes very well, so Lili decides to learn from her grandmother.

On the first day, Lili and her grandmother went to the supermarket to buy flour, eggs, and red bean paste. Back home, her grandmother started teaching Lili. Her grandmother said, "The most important thing about making mooncakes is to have patience." Lili listened carefully.

In the beginning, Lili didn't do well. The dough was too hard, the filling was too little, and the shape of the mooncake was also strange. Lili was a little sad, but she didn't give up. She said to her grandmother, "Grandma, I will work hard!"

Her grandmother smiled and said, "Good girl, it will be better after practicing a few more times." Lili practiced again and again according to her grandmother's method. She kneaded the dough, wrapped the filling, and carefully put it into the oven.

A few days later, Lili’s mooncakes were getting better and better. On the day of the Mid-Autumn Festival, Lili gave the mooncakes to her family to eat. Everyone said, "It's so delicious! The mooncakes made by Lili are the most delicious!" Lili was very happy to hear that. She knows that as long as you work hard, you can do anything well.
