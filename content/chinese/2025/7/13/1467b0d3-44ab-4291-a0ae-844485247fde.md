小明有一个梦想，他想当一名厨师。他很喜欢看电视上的厨艺节目，觉得厨师们做的菜都很漂亮，也很好吃。但是，小明从来没有做过饭。

有一天，小明告诉他的朋友丽丽他的梦想。丽丽笑着说：“这真是个好主意！你可以从简单的菜开始学啊！”

小明听了丽丽的话，觉得很有道理。他开始在网上找简单的中国菜谱。第一个菜谱是西红柿炒鸡蛋。小明买了西红柿和鸡蛋，开始了他的厨师之路。

厨房很热，小明不太习惯。他也不太认识一些调料。但是，他很努力地按照菜谱做。第一次，他做出来的西红柿炒鸡蛋有点咸，也有点糊。丽丽尝了一口，笑着说：“不错！继续加油！”

小明没有放弃。他每天都练习做菜。慢慢地，他做的菜越来越好吃。他开始尝试更多的菜谱。他觉得做饭虽然很辛苦，但是看到别人吃他做的菜，他觉得很开心。

最后，小明做了一桌丰盛的中国菜，请丽丽来品尝。丽丽吃得津津有味，对小明说：“你真的可以当一名厨师了！” 小明笑着说：“谢谢你，丽丽！因为你的鼓励，我才能实现我的梦想！”

## English Translation

Xiao Ming has a dream: he wants to be a chef. He really enjoys watching cooking shows on TV, and he thinks the dishes the chefs make are very beautiful and delicious. However, Xiao Ming has never cooked before.

One day, Xiao Ming tells his friend Li Li about his dream. Li Li says with a smile, "That's a great idea! You can start by learning simple dishes!"

Xiao Ming listens to Li Li's words and thinks it makes sense. He starts searching for simple Chinese recipes online. The first recipe is scrambled eggs with tomatoes. Xiao Ming buys tomatoes and eggs and begins his journey to becoming a chef.

The kitchen is very hot, and Xiao Ming is not used to it. He is also not very familiar with some of the seasonings. However, he tries hard to follow the recipe. The first time, the scrambled eggs with tomatoes he makes are a little salty and a little burnt. Li Li takes a bite and says with a smile, "Not bad! Keep going!"

Xiao Ming does not give up. He practices cooking every day. Slowly, the dishes he makes become more and more delicious. He starts trying more recipes. He thinks that although cooking is hard work, he feels very happy when he sees other people eating the dishes he makes.

Finally, Xiao Ming makes a table full of rich Chinese dishes and invites Li Li to taste them. Li Li eats with relish and says to Xiao Ming, "You really can become a chef!" Xiao Ming says with a smile, "Thank you, Li Li! Because of your encouragement, I was able to realize my dream!"

## Grammatical Points and Analysis
### Resultative Complements:
- **做出来 (zuò chūlái):**  *做 (zuò)* means "to make" and *出来 (chūlái)* indicates the result, meaning "to make it out" or "to successfully make something." This is common for indicating the successful completion or result of an action.
- **看到 (kàn dào):** *看 (kàn)* means "to see" and *到 (dào)* indicates the successful perception, so it means "to see" or "to see something."

###  "的" Structure for Modifying Nouns:
- **做的菜 (zuò de cài):** This is a noun phrase where *做 (zuò)* is a verb ("to make"), and *的 (de)* connects it to *菜 (cài)*, which means "dishes" or "food."  Therefore, *做的菜 (zuò de cài)* means "the dishes that are made".
- **丽丽的话 (Lì Lì de huà):** Means "Li Li's words."
- **他的梦想 (tā de mèngxiǎng):** Means "His dream."

-  **越来越好吃 (yuè lái yuè hǎochī):**  This structure indicates a gradual increase or change. In this case, it means "becoming more and more delicious." *越来越 (yuè lái yuè)* is followed by an adjective to express the continuous increase of that quality.

### "因为…才…" Structure
