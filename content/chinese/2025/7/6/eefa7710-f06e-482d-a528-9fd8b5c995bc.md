丽丽和小明是好朋友。小明下个星期要考中文，但是他觉得有点难。丽丽知道后，就主动帮助小明准备考试。

每天下午放学后，丽丽就去小明家。他们一起复习课本，丽丽教小明读课文，解释生词。小明常常觉得生词很难记，丽丽总是耐心地说：“别着急，多读几遍就好了。我们一起努力！”

有时候，小明会觉得很累，想放弃。丽丽就会鼓励他：“坚持一下！你已经学了很多，再努力一下，一定可以考好的！” 丽丽还会和小明一起做练习题，帮助他找出错误，并解释为什么错。

经过一个星期的努力，小明对中文越来越有信心。考试那天，小明虽然有点紧张，但他想起了丽丽的鼓励，告诉自己要冷静。

考试结束后，小明开心地告诉丽丽：“我觉得这次考得不错！谢谢你帮助我！” 丽丽笑着说：“不用谢！这是我们一起努力的结果。我相信你以后会越来越喜欢中文！” 小明点点头，觉得学习中文也变得有趣起来了。

## English Translation

Lili and Xiaoming are good friends. Xiaoming has a Chinese exam next week, but he feels it's a bit difficult. After Lili knew, she proactively helped Xiaoming prepare for the exam.

Every afternoon after school, Lili went to Xiaoming's house. They reviewed the textbook together. Lili taught Xiaoming to read the text and explained new words. Xiaoming often felt that the new words were difficult to remember, but Lili always patiently said, "Don't worry, just read it a few more times. Let's work hard together!"

Sometimes, Xiaoming would feel very tired and want to give up. Lili would encourage him: "Hang in there! You've already learned a lot. Work a little harder, and you will definitely do well on the exam!" Lili would also do practice questions with Xiaoming, help him find mistakes, and explain why they were wrong.

After a week of hard work, Xiaoming became more and more confident in Chinese. On the day of the exam, although Xiaoming was a little nervous, he remembered Lili's encouragement and told himself to stay calm.

After the exam, Xiaoming happily told Lili, "I think I did well on this exam! Thank you for helping me!" Lili smiled and said, "You're welcome! This is the result of our joint efforts. I believe you will like Chinese more and more in the future!" Xiaoming nodded and felt that learning Chinese became interesting too.
