今天是妈妈的生日，小明想送妈妈一个特别的礼物。他觉得送花太普通了，送衣服妈妈自己会买。他想来想去，决定买一件有意义的礼物。

小明的好朋友丽丽知道后，说：“我知道一家店，里面有很多漂亮的中国画。也许你可以去看看，买一幅画送给你的妈妈。”

小明觉得这个主意很不错。他和丽丽一起去了那家店。店里挂着很多画，有山水画，有人物画，还有花鸟画。小明觉得花鸟画最漂亮，颜色很鲜艳，而且花也代表美好的祝福。

丽丽帮小明选了一幅画。画里画着很多盛开的鲜花，颜色很丰富，看起来很漂亮。小明很喜欢这幅画，觉得妈妈一定会喜欢。

他买了这幅画，小心地包好。晚上，他把画送给了妈妈。妈妈打开礼物，看到这幅美丽的画，非常高兴。她说：“谢谢你，小明！这是我收到的最好的生日礼物。” 小明看到妈妈高兴，心里也觉得很开心。

## English Translation

Today is Mom's birthday, and Xiao Ming wants to give her a special gift. He thinks giving flowers is too ordinary, and Mom would buy clothes for herself. After thinking it over, he decided to buy a meaningful gift.

Xiao Ming's good friend Lili knew about it and said, "I know a shop that has many beautiful Chinese paintings. Maybe you can go and take a look, and buy a painting for your mom."

Xiao Ming thought this was a good idea. He and Lili went to that shop together. The shop had many paintings hanging on the walls, including landscape paintings, figure paintings, and flower-and-bird paintings. Xiao Ming thought the flower-and-bird paintings were the most beautiful, with very vibrant colors, and flowers also represent good wishes.

Lili helped Xiao Ming choose a painting. The painting depicted many blooming flowers, with rich colors, and looked very beautiful. Xiao Ming liked the painting very much, and thought Mom would definitely like it.

He bought the painting and carefully wrapped it. In the evening, he gave the painting to his mom. Mom opened the gift and saw the beautiful painting, and was very happy. She said, "Thank you, Xiao Ming! This is the best birthday gift I have ever received." Xiao Ming felt very happy in his heart seeing his mom happy.
