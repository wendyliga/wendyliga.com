## English Translation

Lili likes to learn calligraphy. She thinks writing calligraphy is very interesting and also challenging. She spends a little time practicing every day.

Xiaoming is Lili's friend. Xiaoming is also learning Chinese, but he thinks Chinese is difficult and wants to give up a little. After Lili knew this, she wanted to help Xiaoming.

One day, Lili wrote a calligraphy and gave it to Xiaoming. This calligraphy says: "Persistence is Victory". She wrote these six characters in beautiful calligraphy.

Xiaoming was very touched when he received Lili's gift. He thought Lili's writing was really beautiful! He asked Lili, "You write so well! How long have you been learning?"

Lili smiled and said, "I haven't been learning for a long time, but I practice every day. Learning Chinese is the same. If you persevere a little bit every day, you will get better and better."

Xiaoming looked at the calligraphy that Lili gave him, and his heart was full of strength. He decided to listen to Lili and persevere in practicing Chinese every day. He hung that calligraphy in his room, so he could see it every day.

From then on, Xiaoming worked harder to learn Chinese. He believed that as long as he persevered, he would definitely be able to learn Chinese well.
