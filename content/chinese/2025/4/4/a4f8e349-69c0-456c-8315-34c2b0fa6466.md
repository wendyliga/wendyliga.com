丽丽和小明是好朋友。春天来了，他们想让家里更漂亮。他们听说附近住着一位会剪纸的艺术家，李奶奶。

有一天，他们一起去了李奶奶的家。李奶奶热情地欢迎了他们。她家里有很多漂亮的剪纸作品，有花，有鸟，还有小动物。丽丽和小明觉得太神奇了！

李奶奶拿出了红纸和剪刀，开始教他们剪纸。“先对折，然后画一个简单的图案，再沿着线剪下来。” 李奶奶一边说，一边示范。

丽丽剪了一个简单的花朵，小明剪了一个小小的太阳。虽然他们的作品不太完美，但是他们很开心。

李奶奶笑着说：“第一次剪得很好！多练习几次，就会更漂亮。”

他们把剪好的窗花带回家，贴在了窗户上。阳光照进来，红色的窗花显得特别温暖。丽丽和小明看着他们的作品，心里充满了快乐。他们觉得，这个春天真美好！

## English Translation

Lily and Xiaoming are good friends. Spring arrived, and they wanted to make their home more beautiful. They heard that a paper-cutting artist, Grandma Li, lived nearby.

One day, they went to Grandma Li's house together. Grandma Li warmly welcomed them. Her house had many beautiful paper-cutting artworks, with flowers, birds, and small animals. Lily and Xiaoming thought it was so magical!

Grandma Li took out red paper and scissors and started teaching them paper cutting. "First fold it in half, then draw a simple pattern, and then cut along the line." Grandma Li said while demonstrating.

Lily cut a simple flower, and Xiaoming cut a small sun. Although their works were not perfect, they were very happy.

Grandma Li smiled and said, "You cut very well for the first time! Practice a few more times, and it will be even more beautiful."

They took the cut paper window decorations home and stuck them on the windows. The sunlight shone in, and the red paper cuttings looked particularly warm. Lily and Xiaoming looked at their works, their hearts filled with happiness. They felt that this spring was truly wonderful!
