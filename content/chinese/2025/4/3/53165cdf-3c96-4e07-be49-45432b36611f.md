## English Translation

Lily and Xiao Ming are good friends. Today, they went to the park together to play. There were many trees and flowers in the park, very beautiful. Lily and Xiao Ming decided to fly kites.

Lily took out a red kite, and Xiao Ming took out a blue kite. They started running, and the kites slowly flew into the sky. The kites flew higher and higher, and Lily and Xiao Ming were very happy.

Suddenly, Lily's kite accidentally got caught on a tall tree. She was very anxious and said, "My kite! What should I do?" Xiao Ming was also very worried. He looked at the kite on the tree and tried to think of a solution.

Xiao Ming said, "Don't worry, Lily. Let's think of a solution together." They first tried jumping up to reach the kite, but the tree was too tall, and they couldn't reach it. Then, Xiao Ming saw a long branch nearby. He picked up the branch and carefully tried to poke the kite.

After trying several times, Xiao Ming finally knocked the kite down from the tree. Lily jumped up happily and said, "Thank you, Xiao Ming! You're great!" They continued to fly kites in the park and had a lot of fun. The sun slowly set, and they decided to go home.
