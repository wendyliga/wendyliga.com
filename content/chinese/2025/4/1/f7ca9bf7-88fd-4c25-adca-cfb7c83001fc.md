## 汉字

丽丽和小明是好朋友。他们都喜欢学习新的东西。今天，他们的老师教他们用毛笔写字。

一开始，丽丽觉得很难。她握毛笔的姿势不太正确，所以写出来的字歪歪扭扭的。小明也觉得不容易，墨水常常滴到纸上，弄得一片黑。

“没关系，丽丽，” 小明说，“我们一起努力！我可以帮你调整握笔的姿势。” 丽丽也鼓励小明：“你写得越来越好了！下次小心一点，墨水就不会滴下来了。”

他们互相帮助，互相鼓励。丽丽练习握笔，小明练习控制墨水。经过一段时间的练习，他们都进步了很多。

最后，他们终于成功地写出了漂亮的“春天”二字。丽丽写的“春”字像一棵小树，充满了生机。小明写的“天”字像蓝色的天空，非常开阔。

他们看着自己写的字，感到非常高兴。他们明白了，只要努力学习，互相帮助，就能克服困难，取得成功。

## English Translation

Lili and Xiaoming are good friends. They both like to learn new things. Today, their teacher taught them how to write with a calligraphy brush.

At first, Lili found it difficult. Her grip on the brush wasn't quite right, so the characters she wrote were crooked. Xiaoming also found it challenging; ink often dripped onto the paper, making it a mess.

"It's okay, Lili," Xiaoming said, "let's work hard together! I can help you adjust your grip on the brush." Lili also encouraged Xiaoming: "You're writing better and better! Be a little more careful next time, and the ink won't drip down."

They helped and encouraged each other. Lili practiced her grip, and Xiaoming practiced controlling the ink. After practicing for a while, they both improved a lot.

Finally, they successfully wrote the beautiful characters "春天" (chūntiān - Spring). The "春" (chūn - Spring) character written by Lili looked like a small tree, full of vitality. The "天" (tiān - Sky) character written by Xiaoming looked like the blue sky, very vast.

They looked at the characters they had written and felt very happy. They understood that as long as they studied hard and helped each other, they could overcome difficulties and achieve success.
