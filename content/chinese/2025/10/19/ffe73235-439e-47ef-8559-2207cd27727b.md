## English Translation
The Double Ninth Festival was approaching, and Xiaoming and Lili decided to help their family prepare Chongyang cakes. First, they went to the market and bought glutinous rice flour and dates, as well as some candies for decoration. Back home, they mixed the glutinous rice flour with their mom and cut the dates into small pieces to add into the batter. The two kids thought it was a lot of fun, and the kitchen was filled with laughter.

After steaming the cakes, Xiaoming and Lili designed a greeting card for the festival. Lili drew a chrysanthemum tree, and Xiaoming wrote: “Wish you health and happiness forever, Grandpa and Grandma!” Once the card was finished, they carefully placed it next to the Chongyang cakes and invited their grandparents to enjoy the snacks.

Grandpa and Grandma were delighted to see the card and cakes. They said, “Thank you! You’ve grown up and become more thoughtful!” Xiaoming and Lili felt proud to hear this. Together with their whole family, they enjoyed the delicious cakes, and the house was filled with a warm and joyous atmosphere.
